# Portal-system-UI
js template for institutions?
entry portals with different forms
i will try to make tempalte for schools(that could be adapted to all kinds of institions)
that inclued, website,blog,news articles, and entries for the system(staff entry(professors/teachers), students entry, faculcy/departments entry, affiliates entry)
I will use js and php mostly
for example if you want to adapt it to other institutions you can use the same pattern:
lets say if its hospital you can replace teachers and studens with doctors and patients, if its police stations, can add administrator and citizen?, for example
as for Traffic Police System you can have govenrment officals(who can add,edit and remove data about citiezns,car fines etc) and citizens who can only view information
about their stuff
